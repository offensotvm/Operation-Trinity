## 🧠 What We Built

Participants built and tested multiple real-world hacking tools during the workshop, including:

### 🛰️ RF Cloner
- Clone RFID/NFC access cards using tools like the Proxmark3 or Flipper Zero.
- Learn how passive & active RFID attacks work in controlled environments.

### 📡 Bluetooth Jammer
- Disrupt nearby Bluetooth communication signals.
- Explore the vulnerabilities of wireless protocols in short-range networks.

### 🖱️ Mouse Ducky
- Custom HID (Human Interface Device) payload injector built on microcontrollers (e.g., Digispark/ESP).
- Simulates malicious keystrokes to automate penetration tasks.

### 📶 Wi-Fi Deauthor
- Deauthentication attack tool using ESP8266/ESP32.
- Disconnects devices from Wi-Fi networks by exploiting management frame vulnerabilities.
